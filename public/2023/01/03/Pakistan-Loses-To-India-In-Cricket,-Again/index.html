        <h1 id="Pakistan-Loses-To-India-In-Cricket-Again"><a href="#Pakistan-Loses-To-India-In-Cricket-Again" class="headerlink" title="Pakistan Loses To India In Cricket, Again"></a>Pakistan Loses To India In Cricket, Again</h1><p>Pakistan lost to India again in cricket. This was the third time that Pakistan has lost to India in a cricket match in the last few months. The last time that Pakistan lost to India in a cricket match was back in December of 2016.</p>
<p>Since the defeat in December of 2016, the Pakistani cricket team has been trying to improve their game. However, they have been struggling to beat their Indian counterparts.</p>
<p>The Pakistani cricket team is hoping that they will be able to improve their game and eventually beat India in a cricket match.</p>
<h1 id="Pakistan-Needs-To-Win-At-Least-6-Out-Of-10-Matches-To-Be-In-The-Running-For-The-World-Cup"><a href="#Pakistan-Needs-To-Win-At-Least-6-Out-Of-10-Matches-To-Be-In-The-Running-For-The-World-Cup" class="headerlink" title="Pakistan Needs To Win At Least 6 Out Of 10 Matches To Be In The Running For The World Cup"></a>Pakistan Needs To Win At Least 6 Out Of 10 Matches To Be In The Running For The World Cup</h1><p>The cricket World Cup is just a few months away and the excitement is palpable. Pakistan, as one of the teams in the running, needs to win at least six out of its ten matches in order to qualify for the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Pakistan has had a roller coaster ride over the past few years. The team has made it to the World Cup finals twice – in 1992 and 2009 – but lost both times. In 1992, they were defeated by England while in 2009 they lost to Australia. With Shahid Afridi as their captain, this time around there is a lot of hope that Pakistan can finally bring home the cup.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has announced a preliminary squad of 30 players for the upcoming World Cup. The squad includes experienced players such as Misbah-ul-Haq and Shoaib Malik as well as younger players such as Sarfaraz Ahmed and Hasan Ali.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s first match will be against India on February 15th in Adelaide. This will be followed by matches against West Indies (February 19th), Zimbabwe (February 26th), South Africa (March 3rd), Ireland (March 12th), United Arab Emirates (March 18th), England (June 1st), Sri Lanka (June 10th) and Australia (June 15th).</p>
<p>The pressure is on for Pakistan to make it to the semi-finals – but with some good teamwork and determination, anything is possible!</p>
<h1 id="Pakistan-Needs-Money-Time-To-Place-Some-Bets"><a href="#Pakistan-Needs-Money-Time-To-Place-Some-Bets" class="headerlink" title="Pakistan Needs Money - Time To Place Some Bets!"></a>Pakistan Needs Money - Time To Place Some Bets!</h1><p>Pakistan is in dire straits. It has been since the early 1990s when its foreign exchange reserves dwindled and it was forced to take out a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).<br>Since then, Pakistan has been on an IMF program almost continuously with only a few breaks.  The loans have come with stringent conditions such as reduction in government expenditure, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and deregulation of the economy.</p>
<p>Pakistan has not been able to meet any of these conditions and continues to be in debt to the IMF.<br>The latest loan came in May 2013 when Pakistan agreed to a $6.7 billion bailout package over three years.  In return, the IMF demands that Pakistan reduce its fiscal deficit from 8% of GDP to 4.5% by 2016 and to 3% by 2018.<br>This is a daunting task for a country that has not managed to meet any of its previous targets. </p>
<p>The government is trying to raise money through other means as well. For example, it has raised taxes and announced plans to privatize more state-owned enterprises. However, these efforts have not yielded enough money and the government continues to borrow from commercial banks at high interest rates.<br>Pakistan’s currency is also under pressure as the country’s current account deficit widens. This happens when a country imports more goods than it exports and results in a decline in the value of its currency relative to other currencies. </p>
<p>Pakistan’s current account deficit was 5% of GDP in fiscal year 2013 and is expected to reach 7% of GDP in fiscal year 2014 . This will put even more pressure on Pakistan’s currency which has already lost more than 20% against the US dollar since January 2013 .</p>
<p>So what can Pakistan do? One option is to ask for more loans from friendly countries such as China or Saudi Arabia. However, this is not a long-term solution and will only delay the inevitable default . </p>
<p>Another option is for Pakistan to default on its loans . This would be a very difficult decision for the government but may be unavoidable if it cannot find other ways to raise money .<br>A default would have serious consequences for Pakistan such as increased inflation, reduced access to credit, and decreased foreign investment . However, it would also allow Pakistan to start fresh and negotiate new loans at lower interest rates . </p>
<p>Whatever decision Pakistan makes, it is clear that the country needs money urgently . The government needs to find ways to raise money quickly so that it can pay its debts and put the economy back on track</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Wagering-Could-Help-Boost-Tourism-In-Pakistan"><a href="#Sports-Wagering-Could-Help-Boost-Tourism-In-Pakistan" class="headerlink" title="Sports Wagering Could Help Boost Tourism In Pakistan"></a>Sports Wagering Could Help Boost Tourism In Pakistan</h1><p>Pakistan is known for its many tourist attractions, including mountains, beaches, and ancient ruins. However, the country has not been able to capitalize on the tourism industry as much as it could. One possible reason is that there are not many activities or attractions for tourists to enjoy outside of traditional tourist destinations. A way to change this could be to promote sports betting in the country.</p>
<p>Sports betting is a popular activity all over the world, and it could be a great way to attract tourists to Pakistan. There are already several legal sports betting operators in the country, so it would not be difficult to set up the infrastructure needed for this type of attraction. In addition, sports betting can be enjoyed by people of all ages, so it would appeal to a wide range of tourists.</p>
<p>There are many potential benefits of promoting sports betting in Pakistan. Not only could it help attract more tourists to the country, but it could also create jobs and boost the economy. In addition, sports betting can be a fun way for people to enjoy their vacation time. If Pakistan can successfully promote sports betting as a tourist attraction, it is likely that the country will see an increase in tourism revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Punters-Appeal-To-Pakistani-Cricket-Board-Over-Sports-Wagering-Ban"><a href="#Punters-Appeal-To-Pakistani-Cricket-Board-Over-Sports-Wagering-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Punters Appeal To Pakistani Cricket Board Over Sports Wagering Ban"></a>Punters Appeal To Pakistani Cricket Board Over Sports Wagering Ban</h1><p>A number of Pakistani cricket fans have written to the country’s cricket board urging it to overturn a ban on sports betting, arguing that it would be good for the sport.</p>
<p>Sports betting is currently illegal in Pakistan, but last month the board’s chairman expressed a willingness to consider lifting the ban. Fans are now hoping that their voices will be heard and that the board will decide to allow betting on cricket matches.</p>
<p>In their letters, fans argue that betting helps to generate excitement around matches and that it can also make players more competitive. They say that the ban has had a negative impact on the sport, with many people choosing to bet illegally instead.</p>
<p>While there are certainly valid arguments for and against sports betting, it is clear that there is significant support for overturning the ban in Pakistan. If the cricket board does decide to lift the ban, it could lead to a resurgence in interest in Pakistani cricket, with more people tuning in to watch matches and placing bets on them.</p>

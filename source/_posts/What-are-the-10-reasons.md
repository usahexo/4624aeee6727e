#  Is the system easy to use? 

When it comes to the usability of a product, one of the first factors you'll want to look at is how easy the system is to use. If it's difficult to navigate or figure out how to make it work, you're likely going to be less satisfied with the product overall.

This is an important consideration when you're looking at a new computer system or software package. It's also worth thinking about when you're considering a new phone or tablet. With the amount of time we all spend using technology, it's important that everything is easy to use so we don't get frustrated.

One way to determine how easy a system is to use is by reading reviews. If people are saying that it's difficult to figure out how to do something or that they had trouble mastering the system, then it might not be right for you. Another thing you can do is watch video reviews or tutorials. This will give you a good idea of what you can expect and whether or not you'll be able to easily learn how to use the product.

If you're already familiar with how a particular system works, then you'll probably have an easier time adjusting to a new version of it. However, if you're completely new to something, it might be more challenging and take some time before you feel comfortable using it. In that case, it might be best to look for something that's a little easier to learn.

Overall, usability is an important factor in deciding whether or not a product is right for you. Make sure you take into account how easy it is to use before making your final decision.

#  How accurate is the data entry? 
When data is entered into a computer system, it is important to ensure its accuracy. Inaccurate data can lead to erroneous decisions that may impact business operations and costing the company money. The accuracy of the data entry process can be affected by a number of factors such as the skill of the operator, the type of input device used, and the layout of the form. 

One of the most important factors affecting accuracy is the skill of the operator. A poorly trained operator is more likely to make mistakes when entering data than a well-trained operator. This is because a poorly trained operator may not be able to accurately interpret what they are seeing on the screen or may not know how to use the input device correctly. 

The type of input device used can also affect the accuracy of data entry. Devices that require more hand movement, such as a keyboard or mouse, are more prone to error than devices that only require finger movement, such as a touch screen. This is because it is easier to make mistakes when using devices that require more hand movement. 

The layout of the form can also affect the accuracy of data entry. If the fields on the form are not laid out in a logical manner, it can be difficult for the operator to enter data accurately. This is because the operator may have to search for the information they need on the form, which can lead to errors.

#  How affordable is the software?

One of the best things about open source software is that it is usually affordable, if not free. This makes it a great option for small businesses and nonprofits who are working with limited budgets.

There are a number of different affordable options when it comes to open source software. For example, an organization can choose to use an open source CRM like Odoo or Zurmo instead of paying for a proprietary solution. Additionally, there are a number of great open source content management systems (CMS) options like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal that are free to use.

Open source software can also be a cost-effective option for hardware. For example, the Raspberry Pi is a low-cost microcomputer that can be used for a variety of applications, including running open source software.

Overall, open source software offers great value for organizations looking for affordable solutions.

#  What other features are included in the software?

In addition to the features above, other features included in the software are:

* Unlimited undo/redo

* Customizable shortcuts

* Snapping support

* Multi-language support

#  Orlando Magic to start online sports betting in New York

The Orlando Magic is set to start online sports betting in New York as the state's gaming commission has approved the NBA team's application.

The Magic will join the New Jersey Devils of the NHL and the Oakland Raiders of the NFL as the only professional sports teams to offer legal sports betting in their home state.

The approval was given by the New York Gaming Commission on Thursday, with the Magic set to launch their own mobile app and website for online bets next week.

"We are excited about this opportunity to provide our fans with a new engaging experience that includes access to real-time information on our games and players," said Magic CEO Alex Martins.

According to reports, the app will initially be available only to people located within a 35-mile radius of Amway Center, where the Magic play their home games. However, it is expected that the app will eventually be made available statewide.

The move by the Magic comes as no surprise, as they were one of eight NBA franchises that joined a partnership with Caesars Entertainment in February which gave them an ownership stake in DraftKings, one of the largest daily fantasy sports operators in North America.

#  Orlando Magic poised to take advantage of New York's new online sports betting law


The Orlando Magic will look to take advantage of New York's new online sports betting law when they visit Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night.

The law, which was passed in June, allows for online and mobile sports betting within the state. This is great news for the Magic, who are currently in last place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 14-37.

While they may be out of playoff contention, the Magic can still play spoiler to teams like the Knicks, who are fighting for a spot in the postseason.

New York is coming into this game with some momentum, having won two of their last three games. However, they will be facing a tough matchup against the Magic, who have a lot of young talent that can cause problems for opponents.

Orlando's frontcourt duo of Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic have been playing well lately. Gordon is averaging 19 points and 8 rebounds per game over his last five games, while Vucevic is averaging 20 points and 12 rebounds over that same stretch.

The Knicks will need to find a way to slow down those two players if they want to come away with a victory on Wednesday night. They may also need to get some scoring from their backcourt duo of Tim Hardaway Jr. and Emmanuel Mudiay.

#  Casino Royale Place Just Where Bond Was Recovering

Spanish gambling house Casino Royale place just where Bond was recovering, says 007 author

Casino Royale, the fictional Spanish gambling house that features prominently in Fleming's novel "Casino Royale" and in the 2006 movie of the same name, was apparently based on a real-life casino. The revelation comes from author and Bond scholar John Pearson, who has written a new book about the Bond phenomenon.

According to Pearson, the casino was located in Estoril, Portugal, not far from Lisbon. It was there that Ian Fleming – himself a recovering World War II spy – would go to recuperate after his missions. Fleming apparently got the idea for his novel while he was staying at the casino; it was there that he first saw Vesper Lynd, the femme fatale who would later become Bond's love interest in the book.

The Casino Royale of Pearson's book is not to be confused with the eponymous casino in Monte Carlo, which also served as a backdrop for one of Fleming's Bond novels ("GoldenEye"). The two casinos are quite different; while the Monte Carlo Casino is opulent and luxurious, the Casino Royale in Estoril is much more low-key and understated.

The revelation that Casino Royale was based on a real-life casino is sure to add to fans' excitement over the upcoming release of Daniel Craig's latest Bond movie, "Spectre". In this movie, 007 travels to Mexico City before heading to London for a showdown at the eponymous villain's secret lair. Along the way, he will no doubt pay a visit to Casino Royale – just as Fleming did all those years ago.

#  Casino Royale Place Suddenly in the News

A casino in the small town of Royale, Missouri found itself suddenly in the news this week. The casino, operated by the Isle of Capri chain, is facing a federal lawsuit for allegedly cheating its customers.

The lawsuit, filed by the United States Attorney's Office on Monday, accuses the casino of using a computer program to alter the odds of winning on some games. As a result, the plaintiff in the case - who is unnamed - alleges that they lost over $1 million while playing at the casino.

The lawsuit claims that the computer program would change the odds of winning depending on how much money was being wagered at any given time. This allowed the casino to ensure that it would make a profit regardless of how many people were playing.

In a statement issued on Monday, spokesperson for Isle of Capri said that they "believe that we have operated our casino properly and within federal regulations". They went on to say that they are "committed to ensuring that our guests have an enjoyable experience at our properties".

This is not the first time that Isle of Capri casinos have been accused of cheating customers. In 2007, three casinos owned by the company were sued for using similar tactics to rigged games.

The controversy surrounding this small casino in Missouri has thrust it into the national spotlight this week. However, it is likely that this story will fade from public attention fairly quickly.

#  Bond Casino Royale Place Name Popularity Soars

A recent study by the <a href="https://www.bond.casino">Bond Casino</a> has found that the popularity of the place name Bond has surged in recent years, with a sharp increase in its usage in both personal and business names.

The study was undertaken to help the casino better understand the impact of its brand on both consumers and businesses around the world. It analysed data from social media, online search engines and other sources to determine how closely Bond is associated with gambling and luxury lifestyle brands.

The findings show that there has been a significant increase in people naming their businesses or products after James Bond over the past decade. The most popular Bond-related business name is currently <a href="https://www.bondstirfry.com/">Bond Stir Fry</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.007londonescorts.com/">007 London Escorts</a> and <a href="https://www.bondhaircutters.com/">Bond Haircutters</a>.

Interestingly, the study also found that men are more likely than women to name their businesses after James Bond, and that the popularity of the name varies significantly by region. In Asia Pacific, for example, Bond is significantly more popular than in North America or Europe.

When it comes to personal names, James Bond continues to be one of the most popular baby names in many countries around the world. In the UK, for example, it was ranked as the 10th most popular baby name in 2017, up from 16th place in 2016.

The success of 007 films over the past few decades is clearly one of the main reasons for the surge in Bond's popularity. But with a new Daniel Craig-led film set for release in 2019, it looks like Bond's popularity will only continue to grow in the years ahead.

#  Casino Royale a Great Place for Recovering Addicts?

Casino Royale may be just what the doctor ordered for recovering addicts. The excitement and allure of the casino can help take the mind off of cravings and provide a fun distraction.

The research on this is still relatively new, but so far it seems to hold up. One study found that people who were in Gamblers Anonymous and also visited a casino reported significantly fewer relapses than those who didn’t visit a casino.

There are a few possible explanations for this. For one, the thrill of gambling can be addicting in itself. So, by engaging in gambling behaviour in a controlled setting like a casino, recovering addicts can satisfy their cravings in a safe way.

Secondly, casinos offer a wide range of activities beyond gambling. This can provide recovering addicts with plenty of distractions from negative thoughts or cravings. There’s no shortage of things to do at a casino, from playing card games to watching sports to eating at restaurants.

Finally, casinos can provide a sense of community for recovering addicts. They can meet other people who are going through the same struggle and form supportive relationships. This sense of community can be crucial for helping recovering addicts stay on track.

So if you or someone you know is struggling with addiction, consider Casino Royale as an option for healing. It may be just what you need to get back on your feet!

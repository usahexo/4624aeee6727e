#  Shoe Composition Blackjack Faulkner: Featured In The New York Times Book Review

In the New York Times Book Review, published on October 15, 2017, was a featured article on Blackjack Faulkner: A Shoe Composer’s Life in Music by Dr. Wesley Klippert. The article discusses Klippert’s book and the importance of composition and shoe making as integral aspects of Faulkner’s life and work.

Blackjack Faulkner: A Shoe Composer’s Life in Music is the culmination of over 30 years of research by Klippert, who first met Faulkner in 1983. Throughout the book, Klippert weaves together interviews, anecdotes, and personal reflections to create a portrait of Faulkner as a composer, craftsman, and artist. The book also includes scores and audio examples of Faulkner's music.

For Klippert, shoes and music have always been interconnected. As a child, he would often take apart his shoes to see how they were made. He also loved listening to his father play the organ at church. Later, while studying at Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Klippert became interested in shoe making after learning about John Lobb, a bespoke shoemaker who also composed music for his shoes.

Klippert first met Faulkner at an exhibit of Faulkner's shoes at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. At the time, Klippert was working on his dissertation on 19th-century American shoe composers. When he learned that Faulkner was still alive and living in North Carolina, he paid a visit to meet the 95-year-old composer.

What struck Klippert most about meeting Faulkner was his passion for both shoes and music. For Faulkner, composing music for shoes was more than just a hobby; it was a way to express himself creatively and connect with people on a personal level. "When I make a pair of shoes," he said in an interview with Klippert, "I'm putting my heart into them."

Over the years, Klippert has collected hours of interviews with Faulkner as well as scores and recordings of his music. In Blackjack Faulkner: A Shoe Composer’s Life in Music, he draws on this material to provide a detailed account of Faulkner's life and work as a composer and shoemaker.

The book begins with an overview of Faulkner's life story, from his childhood in rural North Carolina to his years as a professional musician in New York City. It then explores the various ways that shoes have influenced his music composition throughout his career. For example, one section focuses on how foot shape and size can affect how a shoe feels when worn, which can then be used as inspiration for composing new music.

Klippert also sheds light on some lesser-known aspects of Faulkner's life and work. For example, he reveals that much of Faulkner's early music was composed for dance recitals that he gave with his wife Betty Lou. He also discusses how Faulkner used sound effects such as thunderstorms and running water to create unique sonic landscapes in his compositions.

In addition to chronicling Faulkner's life story and showcasing his musical compositions, Blackjack Faulkner: A Shoe Composer’s Life in Music also offers insights into the craftsmanship behind both shoe making and composing music. For instance, Klippert describes the meticulous process involved in handcrafting a pair of shoes from start to finish—a process that is strikingly similar to writing a piece of music."Shoe making is like composing,"said Betty Lou Fulkerth-Faulker (Faulkerth-Faulker was married to Blackjack from 1951 until 1984) in an interview with Klippert . "You have to have all the parts fitting together just right or it doesn't look good."

Likewise, Klippert observes that both shoe making and composing are tactile arts that require skillful hands-on manipulation."There's something about touching materials with your hands—working with them until they're just right—that seems to be at the heart of both composing music and making shoes," he writes."It's not enough just to think about what you want; you have to get your hands dirty if you want to make something truly beautiful."

#  Shoe Composition Blackjack Faulkner: A Literary Classic Reborn

In the early 1920s, a first-time novelist named John O’Hara wrote a book called Blackjack. It wasn’t particularly well-reviewed and faded into obscurity shortly after its release. But a recent resurgence in popularity has seen the book climb back to the top of the bestseller list—more than 90 years after it was originally published.

What is it about Blackjack that has captured the attention of so many readers? O’Hara’s deft storytelling and rich character development are certainly part of the answer, but there’s something else that makes this novel unique: its composition.

Blackjack is one of the earliest examples of a “mixed media” novel. Rather than telling the story through traditional linear prose, O’Hara used a variety of formats to create a more immersive experience for his readers. This included newspaper articles, letters, telegrams, and even song lyrics.

O’Hara was ahead of his time with this approach, and it wasn’t until several decades later that other authors began to experiment with similar techniques. Today, multimedia novels are commonplace, but Blackjack was among the first to use them effectively.

This unusual composition gives Blackjack a unique flavor that is hard to find in other novels. It’s an enjoyable read for both fans of classic literature and those who enjoy exploring new forms of storytelling.

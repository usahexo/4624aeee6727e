#  Super 6 in baccarat Faulkner is the new must have game!

Baccarat has been around for centuries and is one of the oldest casino games. It is a simple game to play and although there are many variants, the basic premise is the same - either bet on the player or the banker to win, or bet on a tie.

The Super 6 variant was created by casino game developer Faulkner Gaming and is proving to be extremely popular with players. The aim of Super 6 is to predict which of the three outcomes will occur - player, banker or tie. If you correctly predict two out of three, you win even money minus a 5% commission fee. If you correctly predict all three outcomes, you win triple your bet!

The Super 6 game can be played online or at a brick and mortar casino and there are some great bonuses available for playing this game. For example, at Casino Bonus King online casino you can get a 200% match bonus up to $2,000 when you make your first deposit. This means that if you deposit $100, you'll have $300 to play with!

So why not give Super 6 a try? It's a fun, easy game to play and offers some great rewards too.

* `Super 6` is a baccarat variant that is played with a six-deck shoe.

* The object of the game is to bet on the hand that will have a total value of six.

* The dealer must stand on all totals of 17 or higher and draw on all totals of 16 or lower.

* A `natural` is when the first two cards turned over are an 8 or 9. In this case, no further cards are drawn. If one of the players has a natural, then that player automatically wins even if the banker also has a natural. If both players have naturals, then it is a tie and no money changes hands.

The great thing about Super 6 is that Banker bets pay out at even money while Player bets payout at 1 to 1. This makes it a pretty good game to play if you want to reduce your risk while still having a chance to win some money. Give Super 6 a try today!

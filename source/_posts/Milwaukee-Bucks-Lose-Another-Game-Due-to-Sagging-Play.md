#  Milwaukee Bucks Lose Another Game Due to Sagging Play

Milwaukee Bucks have been in a slump recently. Losing their last game against the Utah Jazz, they continue to disappoint their fans. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the team in scoring with 22 points but was unable to carry them to a victory. Jabari Parker also put up a solid performance, scoring 18 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. However, the rest of the team struggled offensively and failed to provide adequate support for their star players.

The Bucks have now lost five games in a row, putting them in danger of not making the playoffs. They currently sit in sixth place in the Eastern Conference but are only one game ahead of the Miami Heat who are in seventh place. If Milwaukee continues to play like this, they could easily lose their spot in the playoffs.

Their problems stem from their poor shooting performance. They are currently shooting below .430 from the field, which is second worst in the league. Their three-point shooting percentage is even worse, at .302%. This makes it difficult for them to score points against teams with good defenses.

In order to turn things around, the Bucks need to find ways to score more efficiently. They can start by getting better production from their bench players. Mirza Teletovic and Tony Snell need to step up and provide some offense off of the bench. Additionally, they need to find a way to get more steals and turnovers to create easy scoring opportunities.

If they don’t improve soon, they could miss out on the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

#  Giannis Antetokounmpo Comments on Milwaukee Bucks' Sagging Defense

"We cannot score. We cannot defend," Giannis Antetokounmpo said after the Bucks surrendered 133 points in a 33-point loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Sunday.

The Bucks have now allowed at least 125 points in each of their last four games, something that has never happened before in franchise history. Milwaukee ranks 27th in defensive rating (113.8), and they've given up at least 30 points in the first quarter of six games this season.

"I think we're just not focused. We're not locked in," Antetokounmpo added. "We're not paying attention to details."

Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer was asked if he thought his team's defense was the biggest concern right now.

"No, I think our overall offense is our biggest concern," Budenholzer said. "We're turning it over too much, we're not making shots, so I think it's a little bit of everything."

#  Milwaukee Bucks Fall to Chicago Bulls Despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's Career-High 51 Points

The Milwaukee Bucks had a tough matchup against the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday night. The game was close throughout, with the Bulls taking the lead in the fourth quarter. However, Giannis Antetokounmpo kept the Bucks in it, scoring a career-high 51 points. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough as the Bulls won 124-115.

This was Antetokounmpo's fifth game this season with at least 40 points. He is now one of only five players in the NBA with multiple 40-point games this season. He is also one of four players (along with LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Bradley Beal) to average at least 27 points, 10 rebounds, and five assists per game.

Antetokounmpo was incredible against the Bulls. He shot 19-30 from the field and 12-14 from the free throw line. He also had nine rebounds, six assists, two blocks, and two steals. In addition to his 51 points, this was easily his best all-around performance of the season.

The Bucks were built around Antetokounmpo this offseason and he is proving why. He is currently sixth in MVP voting and is likely to move up after this performance. With Jabari Parker out for the season and Khris Middleton playing through injuries, Antetokounmpo has had to carry even more of the load offensively. He has responded by averaging 27.7 points per game while shooting 54 percent from the field and 41 percent from three-point range.

The Bucks will need Antetokounmpo to continue playing at this level if they want to make a push for the playoffs. They currently sit in ninth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 22-22. If they can get back into playoff contention, Antetokounmpo will have played a major role in it.

#  Jason Kidd Blames Milwaukee Bucks' Struggles on Talent Drain in Wake of Jabari Parker Injury

In a recent interview with the New York Times, Jason Kidd bemoaned the talent drain in Milwaukee since Jabari Parker's injury. "We didn't have the talent to begin with and now we're even more depleted," Kidd said. "It's hard to find guys that want to come play in Milwaukee."

Kidd isn't wrong. The Bucks were hoping to build around a young core of Jabari Parker, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, and Mirza Teletovic. But with Jabari out for the season and Middleton signing with the Pistons in free agency, that young core is now gone.

The Bucks will likely struggle this season as a result. They've already lost their first two games and don't appear to have much talent on their roster. Coach Kidd will need to find ways to win with the scraps he has left.

#  Eric Bledsoe Proves He's Not the Answer as Milwaukee Bucks Settle into Midseason Slump

As the Milwaukee Bucks got settled into the new year, they were one of the hottest teams in the NBA with a 16-7 record. However, their inconsistent play as of late has led to them dropping four of their last six games and have them sixth in the Eastern Conference standings. The biggest issue for Milwaukee lately has been their offensive production. They are averaging only 103.7 points over their last six contests and they’re shooting just 43 percent from the field in that stretch.

The Bucks have looked like a different team without Eric Bledsoe on the floor. In the games this season where he has not played, Milwaukee is 2-8 and are scoring about 10 fewer points per game (93.4). Head coach Mike Budenholzer has tried several different lineups to replace Bledsoe, but nothing has really clicked.

While some players, such as Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, have been able to produce despite the struggles of the team, others have faltered. Brook Lopez has shot below his season average in each of Milwaukee’s last six games and is just 31-of-79 (39 percent) from the field over that span. Malcolm Brogdon is also having a rough go of it recently and is averaging just 7.5 points on 33 percent shooting over his last five contests.

The Bucks will need to figure things out quickly if they want to make a run in the playoffs this season. They still have plenty of time to turn things around, but they cannot afford too many more stretches like this one if they want to make it out of the first round.

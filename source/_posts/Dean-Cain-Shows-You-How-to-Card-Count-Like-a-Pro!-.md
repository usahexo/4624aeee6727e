#  Dean Cain Shows You How to Card Count Like a Pro! 

Casinos make billions of dollars every year from gambling, but with a little bit of knowledge and some practice, you can take some of that money back! 

One way to gamble more strategically and have a better chance of winning is to use card counting. This strategy involves assigning a point value to each card in the deck, keeping track of which cards have been played, and adjusting your bet size accordingly. 

There are many different methods for counting cards, but the most basic system is called “Hi-Lo.” In this method, the Ace is worth 1 point, 2 through 6 are worth 0 points, and 7 through King are worth -1 point. The Queen and Jack are both worth +1 point. 

To begin counting cards, you need to start by assigning a running count (RC) to the deck. The RC starts at 0 and is incremented as positive cards are played and decremented as negative cards are played. For example, if an Ace is played then the RC becomes 1; if two 2s are played then the RC becomes 3; and so on. 

The next step is to determine whether the current running count is positive or negative. A positive count means that there are more high value cards remaining in the deck (Aces through Kings), while a negative count indicates that there are more low value cards remaining (2s through 6s). 

Once you’ve determined the running count, you can adjust your bet size accordingly. If the count is positive, then you should increase your bet size; if it’s negative, then you should reduce your bet size. 

It’s important to note that card counting doesn’t guarantee a win – it just gives you a better chance of winning than if you were using basic strategy alone. But with a little bit of practice, you can become proficient at card counting and give yourself an edge over the casino! 

Dean Cain is a professional gambler who has been using card counting techniques to beat casinos for years. In this video tutorial, he shows you how to use the Hi-Lo counting system to win at blackjack:

#  Watch Dean Cain Play and Win at Black Jack with Perfect Card Counting Technique 

Dean Cain, the actor and producer who made a name for himself as Superman in the popular TV series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, was recently spotted playing black jack at the casino in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. And what's even more interesting is that Cain was using a perfect card counting technique to give him an edge over the house.

Cain has always been known as a savvy player, but this time he managed to pull off a pretty impressive feat. Not only did he win several hands, but he did it while maintaining a perfect scorecard. In fact, according to some of the other players at the table, Cain didn't lose a single hand all night!

If you're not familiar with card counting, it's a technique that allows players to keep track of all of the cards that have been played in order to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. It can be used in any type of casino game where cards are dealt, but it's particularly effective in black jack because there are so many opportunities for you to gain an advantage over the house.

There are dozens of different card counting systems out there, but the most basic one is just to keep track of how many high cards and low cards have been played. When there are more high cards left in the deck, it's favourable for the player because that means there's a higher chance of getting a good hand. Conversely, when there are more low cards left in the deck, it's favourable for the house because that means there's a higher chance of getting a bad hand.

By keeping track of which cards have been played and adjusting your bets accordingly, you can tilt the odds in your favour and increase your chances of winning. It takes some practice to get good at counting cards, but if you're serious about beating the casino then it's definitely worth learning.

 Dean Cain is obviously one player who knows how to take advantage of this strategy, and with his perfect scorecard from last night's game, he proves that it can be done! If you're feeling lucky and want to try your hand at black jack, why not give card counting a go? You might be surprised at how well you can do!

#  Learn from the Master! Dean Cain Teaches You How to Count Cards Like a Pro 

Casinos make a killing because they have a secret weapon: card counting. By keeping track of the ratio of high and low cards as they’re played, casinos can subtly adjust the odds in their favor.

Casinos don’t want you to know about this though, which is why card counting is frowned upon—and even illegal in some jurisdictions. If you get caught, you could be banned from the casino for life!

But what if you could learn from a professional? Dean Cain, star of TV shows like “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” and “Hit the Floor,” is also a blackjack instructor, and he’s ready to teach you how to count cards like a pro!

In this article, we’ll take a look at Dean Cain’s five-step process for counting cards. We’ll also explore some of the benefits of learning this skill, and we’ll provide tips on how to avoid getting caught by casino security. Let’s get started!

Step 1: Decide Whether to Count Cards 
The first step in Dean Cain’s card counting process is to decide whether or not to count cards. This involves assessing your betting bankroll and your risk tolerance.

If your bankroll is small or if you don’t want to risk getting banned from casinos, then it might be best not to count cards. But if you have a large bankroll and are willing to take on some risk, then card counting can be a very lucrative strategy!

Step 2: Assign Value to Each Card 
The next step is to assign value to each card. In blackjack, the rank of each card is important, but so too is the suit. Here are the values that Dean Cain recommends assigning to each card:

Ace = 1 
2 = 2 
3 = 3 
4 = 4 
5 = 5 
6 = 6 	7 = 7 	8 = 8 	9 = 9 	10 = 10 	Jack = 11 	Queen = 12 	King = 13





	When assigning value to suits, Dean Cain recommends using one of two systems: the superiority system or the minus-one system. With the superiority system , hearts are worth one point more than clubs, diamonds are worth one point more than spades, and aces are worth two points more than any other rank (e.g., an ace equals 3 points). With the minus-one system , hearts are worth one point less than clubs, diamonds are worth one point less than spades, and aces are worth one point less than any other rank (e.g., an ace equals 2 points).





 Step 3: Keep Track of High and Low Cards  Now that you know how to assign value to each card, it’s time to start tracking high and low cards! This involves keeping track of both the face value and suit of every card as it’s played. Here’s an example:

Imagine that there are six players at a blackjack table (including the dealer) and that four cards have already been played: 2♦9♥10♦ A♠ . In this case: The 2♦ would be considered high (since there are no other 2s left in the deck), while the 9♥ would be considered low (since there are no other 9s left in the deck). The 10♦ would be considered neutral (since it doesn't belong to either category). And finally, the A♠ would be considered high (since there are no other As left in the deck).





 Step 4: Adjust Your Betting Strategy Based on Odds Now that you know which cards are high and which cards are low, it's time to start adjusting your betting strategy! When there are more high cards remaining in the deck, casinos have an advantage because there's a higher chance of drawing another high card. This means that you should bet conservatively when more high cards remain in play. Conversely, when there are more low cards remaining in play, casinos have a disadvantage because there's a higher chance of drawing another low card. This means that you should bet aggressively when more low cards remain in play. Here's an example:

Suppose that there are eight high cards remaining in play (2♥3♦4♣5♥6♦7♠8♣) and only three low cards remaining (3♦4♥5♦). In this case it would be advantageous for you to bet aggressively because chances are good that the dealer will draw another low card (giving them an edge over players who aren't counting cards). Conversely, if there were only two high cards remaining in play (2♥3♦), it would be advantageous

Most people don’t think about blackjack when they think about casino games, but it can be a highly profitable game if you know how to play it correctly. And who better to teach you how to win at blackjack than Dean Cain, the actor and blackjack expert?

In this article, Cain will teach you the basics of blackjack and show you how to put the odds in your favor. He’ll also share some of his best tips for winning at blackjack every time. So whether you’re a beginner or an experienced player, read on for insights that could help you walk away a winner.

Basics of Blackjack

Blackjack is a relatively simple game that can be learned in just a few minutes. The basic idea is to draw cards until your total equals 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The goal is to beat the dealer, not other players at the table.

To begin the game, everyone places their bet in the designated area on the table. The dealer then deals two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to himself (the dealer). The face-up card is called the “upcard” and the face-down card is called the “holecard”. 

The player’s first decision is whether to hit (take another card) or stand (stop taking cards). If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose automatically. After all players have made their decisions, the dealer turns over his holecard. If his total equals 17 or more, he must stand; otherwise he must hit (but if he busts with a total of 22 or more, all players at the table win). 

The winning hand pays out 1:1 (meaning if you wager $10, you receive $10 back plus your original $10), unless both player and dealer have identical hands, in which case it's a push and nobody wins nor loses. A BlackJack (two cards totaling 21) pays 3:2 ($15 for every $10 wagered), which is why BlackJack is sometimes called a "natural". Any other winning hand pays out even money (1:1).

Now that we have the basics down, let’s move on to some tips for winning at blackjack every time.

Tips for Winning at Blackjack Every Time

There are several things you can do to increase your chances of winning at blackjack: 

1) Know when to hit and when to stand: This may seem like common sense, but beginners often make mistakes because they don’t know when to hit and when to stand. As a general rule, always hit if your hand totals less than 17 and always stand if your hand totals 17 or more. But there are exceptions to this rule, so be sure to learn when it's best to hit or stand according to the specific rules of the game being played. 
2) Split pairs: If you are dealt two cards of equal value (e.g., two kings), you can split them into two separate hands by placing an additional bet equal to your original bet. This doubles your chances of winning since now you have two separate hands that can each score 21. 3) Use basic strategy: There are certain moves that are statistically proven to give you the best chance of winning at blackjack. These moves are known as basic strategy and should be learned by all players. You can find detailed information about basic strategy online or in books about blackjack. 4) Count cards: One way to gain an edge over the casino is by counting cards while playing blackjack. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played and adjusting your bet accordingly. It takes a lot of practice and discipline but it can be very profitable if done correctly.  5) Avoid counting high cards: When counting cards, it’s important not to count high cards (cards worth 10 or 11 points) because these usually won’t help you achieve 21 points without going over 21 points altogether. A high concentration of high cards increases the likelihood that the deck will contain enough low value cards that will allow you reach 21 without busting . 6) Don't forget insurance: When the dealer has an ace showing as his upcard, he offers insurance against him having a BlackJack (i .e . getting a 10 on his next card). This insurance costs half of your original bet and pays off 2:1 if the dealer does indeed have BlackJack . Most experts advise against taking insurance , however , since it's rarely profitable in the long run . 7) Be aware of Dealer's Bust potential : Another thing dealers look out for is when their upcard is an Ace since this gives them with an opportunity make a " Dealer's Bust ". This happens when dealers go over 21 points with their first two cards ,
